## About
**Double-filter** - do you have two images: first before filter, and second after? You can make this filter,<br/> save, send, and open them, and of course use for any other images
## Rules (RUS)
- Make filter or download from other sourse with extension `.dfil`
- Filter size around 10-50 kb, this is a huge advantage, becouse you can make presents without knowing all the settings, third-party programs, you do not need to convert some presets from one program to another
- Open image, use any filter, click to image for compare before and after
- Dowload app and learn about other techniques!

## Dowload
 - Download `build` for speed run<br/>
 - Download `sourse` and open in `Qt` for customise run
